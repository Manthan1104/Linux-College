# Experiment 8

1. Write shell scripts to print system information.
2. Write shell script to perform basic mathematical calculation.
3. Use redirection operators to store the output of commands.

---

## Approach

### 1. Write shell scripts to print system information.

1. Make a shell file and open it in the editor
   ```bash
   nano script1.sh
   ```

2. Write the commands to print system information
   
   ![script](script1.png)


4. To save and exit the file press (ctrl + x) and then (ctrl + y)


5. In the terminal ececute the shell file with the command
   ```bash
   bash script1.sh
   ```
   
6. The commnds written in the shell file will be executed.

### 2. Write shell script to perform basic mathematical calculation.

1. Make a shell file and open it in the editor
   ```bash
   nano script2.sh
   ```

2. Write the commands to performe basic mathematical calculation
   
   ![script2](script2.png)


4. To save and exit the file press (ctrl + x) and then (ctrl + y)


5. In the terminal ececute the shell file with the command
   ```bash
   bash script2.sh
   ```
   
6. The commnds written in the shell file will be executed.

### 3. Use redirection operators to store the output of commands.

1. Make a shell file and open it in the editor
   ```bash
   nano script3.sh
   ```

2. Write the commands to use redirection operators to store output of commands
   
   ![script3](script3.png)


4. To save and exit the file press (ctrl + x) and then (ctrl + y)


5. In the terminal ececute the shell file with the command
   ```bash
   bash script3.sh
   ```
   
6. The commnds written in the shell file will be executed.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we practised:
1. Shell scripts to print system information.
2. Shell script to performe basic mathematical calculation.
3. Shell script to use redirection operators to store the output of commands.
